# Cartoon Quiz

This project was developed as a school group-project at Medieinstitutet. 

The aim was to create a quiz in theme of choice.
We chose to create a quiz about cartoons because it felt fun to play with happy colors.

Troughout this project we focused on learning how to work as a group, both individually and pair coding. I hope you enjoy. 

## Requirements for this assigment

* Create a quiz with 20 questions
* Each question should have 3 answer options, and only 1 option should be correct.
* The questions should be presented in random order, with 10 questions shown per round.
* If the user chooses to play again, the same 10 questions should not appear again.
* Points should be awarded for correct answers.
* Only one question should be displayed at a time on the screen.
* Timer (counting upwards). The timer should stop once all questions have been answered.
* A confirmation box should display the number of correct answers (out of the total number of questions) and the total time taken.
* Each person should have made at least two pull requests.
* Work with the project according to the agile method, SCRUM.
